# Windows DLL Injector

## Usage:

    DLL_Inject.exe <Executable_Name> <Path_To_DLL>

I did a writeup on how a basic DLL injection can be achieved by using `CreateRemoteThread` and `LoadLibrary`. Note that this is a noisy way to inject a DLL into a remote process, and was implemented for educational purposes. See my [blog post](https://arvanaghi.com).
